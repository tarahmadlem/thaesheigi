Cars: Being a younger game, Asphalt 9 has only 48 cars compared to No Limit's 71 cars. Cars are divided into 5 classes like in A8 and AX. For D class.

Need For Speed Pro Street was probably the most underrated Need For Speed in the franchise. My concept of Prostreet 2 implements parts of the original Prostreet, some aspects of local racing leagues, track days, real-life racing series. I will go in depth with this concept so bear with me. CAREER MODE: In the Original ProStreet, you are Ryan Cooper, a former street racer gone legal. One thing I disliked about the plot in ProStreet was the fact the career mode lacked a good prologue.you.
