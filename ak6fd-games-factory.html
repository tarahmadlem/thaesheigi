I owned a factory sealed pc version of oblivion anniversary I bought few years back from supermarket for couple pounds and opened it. It's worth a fair bit sealed. I ordered one on Feb 28th and another on March 13 but I haven't received a shipping notice or any update. I understand they are probably swamped with orders but has anyone got theirs yet? How do they look? EDIT: I should mention, I mean the light up marquees. Anybody else still waiting on outstanding orders? I placed mine back in March. Trying to be patient but I'm getting a bit nervous.
